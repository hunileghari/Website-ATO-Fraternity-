                    <p>To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, 
                        with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity ; to know no North, 
                        no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should 
                        stand together. <br> -Otis Allan Glazebrook, 1880</p>
