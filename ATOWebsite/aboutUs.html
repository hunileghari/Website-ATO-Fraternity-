                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p id="mission">Our mission is to promote brotherly love between the members of our organization. <br>A brotherhood 
                    that is free from the issues of race, injustice and inequality. <br>We hope to create gentlemen who stand 
                    together and prove to be leaders in every walk of life. <br>We believe that morals are more important than politics 
                    and our members are taught to recognize merit wherever found.

                <h2>Our House</h2>
                <p>Our chapter is the large white house located at 504 East Seminary St, across from Delta Tau Delta and sharing a parking 
                    lot with Beta, Sig Chi, and Pi Phi. <br>Our house can sleep 120 comfortably, but we usually maintain about 50-60 guys, 
                    so everyone has enough room to spread out. <br>We hold brotherhood events frequently to reinforce our bonds as brothers and it 
                    gives us an opportunity to get out of Greencastle. <br> <br>Weâ€™re one of the closest groups of guys on campus and you too can find 
                    your place here, whether your're a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior. </p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Alpha Tau Omega was founded on September 11, 1865 at the Virginia Military Institute by Alfred Marshall, 
                    Otis Allen Glazebrook and Eskine Mayo Ross. <br><br>The purpose of ATO was to form a sense of brotherhood between Christians 
                    to help promote harmony between the North and South after the American Civil War. <br><br>The organization has 250 existing chapters 
                    and around 229,000 members worldwide.  </p>

                    <p>To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, 
                        with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity ; to know no North, 
                        no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should 
                        stand together. <br> -Otis Allan Glazebrook, 1880</p>
