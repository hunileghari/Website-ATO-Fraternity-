                <h2>Rush ATO!</h2>
                <p>Rush at DePauw is a 3 day process.
                    Round 1 takes place on the first day; you go to every single house, get a tour of the house and meet the brothers.
                    Round 2 takes place on the second day; you go to your top 5 picked houses; you get to know the brothers and the house better 
                    Round 3 takes place on the third and final day; you go to your top 2 houses and get to know the brothers and the house on a deeper level and also start finalizing your top choice. 
                    You select your final choice and if they select you back, you get your bid that night.

                <h2>Rush Advice</h2>
                <p>Get to know all the guys and see where you fit in. <br> 
                    <br>
                    Be a leader not a follower. <br><br> Join a house where you feel like you fit in 
                    not where your friends/family want you to go. <br><br> It is important to join a house where you can see yourself growing as a person. <br><br>
                    Make sure youâ€™re putting in the effort of getting to know the guys in every fraternity you are interested in. <br><br> DePauw is 70% greek affiliated 
                    so this is definitely a very important decision in your college experience, the friends you make here will be your friends for life.</p>

                    <h3>Alpha Tau Omega Creed</h3>
                    <p>To bind men together in a brotherhood based upon eternal and immutable principles, 
                        with a bond as strong as right itself and as lasting as humanity ; to know no North, 
                        no South, no East, no West, but to know man as man, to teach that true men the world over should 
                        stand together. <br> -Otis Allan Glazebrook, 1880</p>
